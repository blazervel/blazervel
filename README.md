# Blazervel for Laravel
Finally, everything has a home (inspired by [Trailblazer.to](https://trailblazer.to)).

## What is it?
Here is a rundown of the tools/objects used in Blazervel.

### Policies & Gates
- As they were

### Controllers
- Instantly delegate to an operation

### Operations
- Handle all business logic

### Contracts
- Hold all validation rules for a model

### Models
- Solely define associations and scopes
- No logic, validations, or callbacks

### Views
- HTML/Blade/Vue/React with zero code

### Cells
- Partial views

## Nameing conventions and folder structure
Blazervel is opinionated and strict. So you can spend more time thinking about what you're going to build and less on how.
